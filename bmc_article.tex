\begin{abstract} % abstract
This paper is a tutorial developed for the data analysis platform Galaxy. The
Galaxy's concept makes high-throughput computational data analysis a
structured, reproducible and transparent process. In this tutorial we
focus on 3 questions: How are protein-ligand systems parameterized for
molecular dynamics simulation? What kind of analysis can be carried out
on molecular trajectories? How can high-throughput MD be used to study
multiple ligands? After finishing you will be able to learn about
force-fields and MD parameterization, learn how to conduct MD simulation
and analysis for a protein-ligand system, understand how different
molecular interactions contribute to the binding affinity of various
ligands for the Hsp90 protein. Requirements for this tutorial is a
minimal Galaxy experience and a Galaxy account on the Galaxy Europe
server. The estimated duration of this tutorial is around 3 hours.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) ... However, the barrier to entry for MD simulation is high; not only is the theory difficult to master, but commonly used MD software is technically demanding. Furthermore, generating reliable, reproducible simulation data requires the user to maintain detailed records of all parameters and files used, which again poses a challenge to newcomers to the field. One solution to the latter problem is usage of a workflow management system such as Galaxy, KNIME or CWL; both the former provide molecular dynamics tools/nodes.

This tutorial provides a detailed workflow for high-throughput molecular dynamics using Galaxy. Galaxy
\cite{afgan2018galaxy} is a data analysis platform that provides access to thousands of tools for scientific computation. It features a web-based user interface while automatically and transparently managing underlying computation details. Galaxy's
concept makes high-throughput sequencing data analysis a structured, reproducible and transparent process.

The aim of this tutorial is to guide the user through the various steps of a molecular dynamics study, from accessing publicly available crystal structures, to performing MD simulation (leveraging the popular GROMACS engine), to analysis of the results.

The entire analysis described this article can be conducted efficiently on any Galaxy server which has the needed tools. In particular, we recommend using the Galaxy Europe server
(\url{https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/}) or the Galaxy South Africa server (\url{https://galaxy-compchem.ilifu.ac.za/}).

The tutorial presented in this article has been developed by the Galaxy Training Network \cite{batut2018community} and its most up-to-date
version is available online on the \href{https://training.galaxyproject.org/topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/htmd-analysis/tutorial.html}{Galaxy Training Materials} website.

This tutorial provides an introduction to using high-throughput
molecular dynamics to study protein-ligand interaction, as applied to
N-terminus of Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90).

\subsection*{What is high-throughput molecular
dynamics?}\label{what-is-high-throughput-molecular-dynamics}

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a method to simulate molecular motion by
iterative application of Newton's laws of motion. It is often applied to
large biomolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. A common
application is to assess the interaction between these macromolecules
and a number of small molecules (e.g.~potential drug candidates). This
tutorial provides a guide to setting up and running a high-throughput
workflow for screening multiple small molecules, using the open-source
GROMACS tools provided through the Galaxy platform.

\subsection*{Why is Hsp90 interesting to
study?}\label{why-is-hsp90-interesting-to-study}

The 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a chaperone protein responsible
for catalyzing the conversion of a wide variety of proteins to a
functional form; examples of the Hsp90 clientele, which totals several
hundred proteins, include nuclear steroid hormone receptors and protein
kinases. The mechanism by which Hsp90 acts varies between clients, as
does the client binding site; the process is dependent on
post-translational modifications of Hsp90 and the identity of
co-chaperones which bind and regulate the conformational cycle.

Due to its vital biochemical role as a chaperone protein involved in
facilitating the folding of many client proteins, Hsp90 is an attractive
pharmaceutical target. In particular, as protein folding is a potential
bottleneck to slow cellular reproduction and growth, blocking Hsp90
function using inhibitors which bind tightly to the ATP binding site
could assist in treating cancer; for example, the antibiotic
geldanamycin and its analogs are under investigation as possible
anti-tumor agents.

\subsection{Get data}\label{get-data}}

First of all, download the required data.

\textbf{\emph{Hands-on: Data upload}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a new history for this tutorial

\item
  Rename the dataset to `Hsp90 structure'
\item
  Search Galaxy for the 'Get PDB' tool. Request the accession code \texttt{6hhr}.
\item
  Check that the datatype is correct (PDB file).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Topology generation}\label{topology-generation}

Now we have downloaded a PDB structure of the protein we wish to study, we will start parameterizing it for MD simulation.

GROMACS distinguishes between constant and dynamic attributes of the
atoms in the system. The constant attributes (e.g. atom charges, bonds
connecting atoms) are listed in the topology (TOP file), while dynamic
attributes (attributes that can change during a simulation, e.g. atom
position, velocities and forces) are stored in structure (PDB or GRO)
and trajectory (XTC and TRR) files.

The PDB file we start from only explicitly states atom type and
position. Therefore, before beginning simulation, we need to calculate
the rest of the information contained within the topology file. There
are a range of force fields which perform these calculations in slightly
different ways.

% perhaps some more discussion here and a citation of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117319302157

Parameterization needs to be done separately for the ligand and protein.
Therefore, the first step is to separate the PDB file into two sets of
coordinates - one for the ligand and one for the protein.

\subsubsection{Extract protein and ligand
coordinates}\label{extract-protein-and-ligand-coordinates}



\begin{quote}
\subsubsection{Hands-on: Task
description}\label{hands-on-task-description}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Search in textfiles} with the following parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``Select lines from''}: `Hsp90 structure'\\
  \item
    \emph{``that''}: \texttt{Don\textquotesingle{}t\ Match}
  \item
    \emph{``Regular Expression''}: \texttt{HETATM}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rename output to `Protein (PDB)'
\item
  \textbf{Search in textfiles} with the following parameters:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``Select lines from''}: `Hsp90 structure'\\
  \item
    \emph{``that''}: \texttt{Match}
  \item
    \emph{``Regular Expression''}: \texttt{AG5E}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Rename output to `Ligand (PDB)'
\end{enumerate}


\end{quote}

\hypertarget{set-up-protein-topology}{%
\subsubsection{Set up protein topology}\label{set-up-protein-topology}}

Firstly, we need to calculate the topology for the protein file. We will
use the \textbf{GROMACS initial setup} tool.

\begin{quote}
\subsubsection{Hands-on: Task
description}\label{hands-on-task-description-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{GROMACS initial setup} with the following parameters:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``PDB input file''}: `Protein (PDB)' file
  \item
    \emph{``Force field''}: \texttt{gaff}
  \item
    \emph{``Water model''}: \texttt{TIP3P}
  \item
    \emph{``Generate detailed log''}: \texttt{Yes}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\end{quote}

The tool produces four outputs: a GRO file (containing the coordinates
of the protein), a TOP file (containing other information, including on
charges, masses, bonds and angles), an ITP file (which will be used to
restrain the protein position in the equilibration step later on), and a
log for the tool.

Please note all GROMACS tools output a log. Generally, you only need to
look at this when a job fails. It provides useful information for
debugging if we encounter any problems.

\subsubsection{Generate a topology for the
ligand}\label{generate-a-topology-for-the-ligand}

To generate a topology for the ligand, we will use the \textbf{acpype}
tool. This provides a convenient interface to the AmberTools suite and
allows us to easily create the ligand topology in the format required by
GROMACS.

\begin{quote}
\subsubsection{Hands-on: Task
description}\label{hands-on-task-description-2}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Generate MD topologies for small molecules} with the following
  parameters:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{``Input file''}: `Ligand (PDB)'
  \item
    \emph{``Charge of the molecule''}: \texttt{0}
  \item
    \emph{``Multiplicity''}: \texttt{1}
  \item
    \emph{``Force field to use for parameterization''}:
    \texttt{AMBER14SB}
  \item
    \emph{``Save GRO file?''}: \texttt{Yes}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\end{quote}

\subsection{Solvation and energy
minimization}\label{solvation-and-energy-minimization}

Having generated topologies, we now need to combine them, define the box
which contains the system, add solvent and ions, and perform an energy
minimization step.

\subsubsection{Combine topology and GRO
files}\label{combine-topology-and-gro-files}

\begin{quote}
\subsubsection{Hands-on: Combine GRO
files}\label{hands-on-combine-gro-files}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  Returning to the first tab, open the protein TOP file using the text
  editor integrated into Galaxy by clicking on the
  \texttt{Visualize\ this\ data} button on the dataset.
\item
  Paste the lines from the ligand ITP file near to the top of the file,
  just after the line \texttt{\#include\ "amber99sb.ff/forcefield.itp"}.
\item
  Go back to the ligand ITP file and select the rest of the file (from
  \texttt{{[}\ moleculetypes\ {]}}) onwards. Copy the selection.
\item
  In the protein TOP file, paste the selection near to the bottom of the
  file, before the line \texttt{;\ Include\ water\ topology} (and just
  after the position restraint file). Notice that the
  \texttt{{[}\ moleculetype\ {]}} section you just copied starts with
  \texttt{base} - this is the name acpype has given to the ligand. Feel
  free to change this to whatever you prefer - \texttt{ligand}, or
  \texttt{GSE}.
\item
  Finally, we need to state in the topology that we have included a new
  kind of molecule. Go to the final section
  (\texttt{{[}\ molecules\ {]}}) and add a new line \texttt{base} (or
  whatever name you gave the ligand in step 5), with a 1 in the
  \texttt{\#mols} column.
\item
  Click \texttt{Export} to save your changes as a new dataset. Make sure
  the datatype of the new file is still \texttt{TOP}. Rename to
  \texttt{System\ topology}.

If this procedure was too complicated, you can download the combined

Having stabilized the temperature of the system with NVT equilibration,
we also need to stabilize the pressure of the system. We therefore
equilibrate again using the NPT (constant number of particles, pressure,
temperature) ensemble.

Note that we can continue where the last simulation left off (with new
parameters) by using the checkpoint (CPT) file saved at the end of the
NVT simulation.

We can estimate the binding free energy between a ligand and a receptor

the simplest form of calculation - a Single Trajectory Estimate - A
simulation of the complex in water is run, this was done with GROMACS
previously. The trajectory of this complex is used to estimate the

The MMPBSA tool support AMBER topologies only. To convert from GROMACS
.top and .gro to Amber topologies, use the following tool which uses
AMBER's parmed to carry out the conversion. The result will be 4 prmtop
files which are required for the binding free energy estimate
calculation.

\subsection*{Optional: Automating high throughput
calculations}\label{optional-automating-high-throughput-calculations}}

In the scenario where large batches of simulations are needed, then
strategies to automate this process are needed. Before rushing into high
throughput make sure to understand your process, the tools and
parameters, data and outputs quite well. Junk in will mean junk out. The
same applies for high throughput, but you will get more junk and waste
more resources. First understand the complete process for at least 2
systems and use this experience to understand where errors are likely to
occur. Second create a workflow and run this on 2-3 systems. Again check
for errors, complete a cursory analysis to ensure selected parameters
give reasonable results.\\
At this point you may realise that manual intervention is required for
certain systems. If this is at the setup stage, then create multiple
histories (either manually or perhaps with bioblend), complete the
manual task and then run a workflow. Realise if there is a manual task,
automation can only be applied to part of the system. Maybe manually
choosing to run workflows will be sufficient. Third start to consider
automation. Create a history with data that has been made into a
collection. Run your workflow. If this works that is great. If not
consider using bioblend.

\section*{Results and Discussion}\label{resultsanddiscussion}}
After the completion of the simulation. An important questions will often be is the simulation length sufficient. The timescale of motions of interest are in the ps to ns range, these are motions such as domain vibration, hydrogen bond breaking, translation diffusion and side chain fluctuations. To observe meaningful conformational transitions of the protein then $\mu$s sampling would be needed, but this is not the purpose here. The PCA cosine content is another measure if it is close to 1 then the length is insufficient. While close to 0 is not enough to determine that this is sufficient. Here, the cosine content is 0.084, indicating that sampling is most likely sufficient.

\subsection*{RMSD protein}
The RMSD timeseries for the protein shows a thermally stable and equilibrated structure with
an average RMSD between 1 and 1.3. There are no large conformational changes during the simulation. The RMSD histogram confirms this, see Figure \ref{fig:rmsdprotein}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{\csentence{RMSD for protein.}
      RMSD time series and histogram for the protein.}
\label{fig:rmsdprotein}
      \end{figure}
%\includegraphics{images/htmd_analysis_rmsd1_series.png}
%\includegraphics{images/htmd_analysis_rmsd1_histo.png}

\subsection*{RMSD ligand}
Calculating the RMSD of the ligand is necessary to check if it is stable in the active site and to identify possible binding modes. If theligand is not stable the RMSD will fluctuate excessively and there will
large fluctuations in the RMSD.

In this case the RMSD seems to stabilise at 1.0 and then transitions back to 0.5. This is more clearly seen in the histogram. There is a bimodal distribution with centres at 0.3 and 1.0 which both have significant populations. There are two binding poses. These can be visually assessed. In this case the
poses were viewed in VMD \cite{hump_vmd_1996} (see Figure \ref{fig:rmsdligand}).

%\includegraphics{images/htmd_analysis_rmsd2_histo.png}
%\includegraphics{images/htmd_analysis_bindingposes.png}

\subsection*{RMSF}
When considering the RMSF fluctuations greater than 1 Angstrom are worth
considering. These are seen near residue position 50, 110 and 160. Very
large fluctuations are seen for the final residues i.e.~the C-terminus.
Fairly common and no investigation is needed. The movement could be
related to binding or other motions.

\subsection*{PCA}

The first principal component (PC1) is most important accounting for
32.36\% of the variance (see PC1 vs PC2 and Eigenvalue rank plots). More
information on PCA can be found in the
\href{http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/tutorials/trajectory-analysis}{BIO3D
tutorial}. The RMSF is in good correlation with PC1.

%\includegraphics{images/htmd_analysis_pc1_rmsf.png}

\subsection*{Hydrogen bonding and further analysis}
The active site of this protein is quite hydrophobic. Only 1 hydrogen
bond is seen between the ligand and Hsp90, this is between Threonine 184
and the ligand. This hydogren bond is not persisent, the occupancy is
small, 0.20\%, the hydrogen is not present for most of the simulation
(according to the criteria for hydrogen bonding).
There are many alternative analyses that have not been considered for the sake of brevity. TODO consider adding another line or two.
